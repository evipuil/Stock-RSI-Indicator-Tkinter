This program uses data from yfinance to plot the price action of a particular stock. 
The program provides information such as the moving averages and the RSI to give traders more information.

To use it, run the program, it will generate a Tkinter window. Input a stock ticker to chart the price in its entire history.

Feel free to clone this project. It is largely a proof of concept of the yfinance library.
